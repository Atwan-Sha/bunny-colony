# bunny-colony

Program that simulates a colony of bunnies with a zombie infection, with all stats printed in four .txt files.
The project is a version of the last exercise "Graduation" found here: https://cplusplus.com/forum/articles/12974/

Still has some minor bugs and the code needs restructuring.

Improved version done by my friend Michael can be found here : https://github.com/michael-pruglo/god-save-bunnies
